Using MongoDB trademarks correctly protects MongoDB brands and
intellectual property, and promotes our reputation. Using third-party
trademarks correctly protects MongoDB from legal action.

MongoDB Legal has created comprehensive guidelines for using trademarks
at MongoDB. To get a comprehensive view of trademarks, read the
:website:`MongoDB Trademark Standards for Use </legal/trademark-usage-guidelines>`.
If you're interested in only what you need to know to comply with
guidelines in your documentation, review the guidelines in this topic.

.. example::

   Following are examples of MongoDB trademarks:

   -  MongoDB (when used in connection with service names), such as
      MongoDB Ops Manager or MongoDB Atlas

   For a complete list, see the
   :website:`MongoDB Trademark Standards for Use </legal/trademark-usage-guidelines>`.

Researching Third-Party Trademarks
----------------------------------

You can search
`Trademark Electronic Search System (TESS) <http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=tess&state=4810:ipxvn6.1.1>`_
from the United States Patent and Trademark Office to find trademarked
products, services, and company names.

Before using a trademark for a new offering in your content, make sure
that you follow any specified trademark guidelines.

To verify whether a name is trademarked, see that company's website.

   * - Guideline

     - Example - Use

     - Example - Don't use

   * - Show a trademark exactly the owning company (MongoDB or
       third-party) displays it. Don't change the capitalization or
       abbreviate the trademark.

       Use an abbreviation if the owning company used and
       trademarked it.

     - This article describes the process of backing up a Microsoft
       SQL Server 2008 database. These actions need to be completed by
       the administrator user or by a user who is part of the SQL
       Server administration user group.

     - This article describes the process of backing up an MS SQL
       Server 2008 database. These actions need to be completed by the
       Administrator user or by a user that's part of the MS SQL Admin
       user group.

   * - Use trademarks as adjectives on first use in the text of an
       article or chapter, and as often as possible after that.

       After first use, you can use the trademark as an noun if it's
       clear that you're referring to that trademark.

       Don't use a trademark as a verb.

     - Each cluster has a single private IP address. When you use
       the MongoDB database on Atlas, if you need direct access to the
       cluster from the Internet, you can use the public IP
       assigned to the cluster in Atlas.

     - Each cluster has a single private IP address. When you use
       the MongoDB, if you need direct access to the cluster
       from the Internet, you can use the public IP assigned to the
       Atlased cluster.

   * - Don't combine a trademark with any other term, including another
       trademark. For example, don't attach a trademark to another term
       by using a hyphen or slash.

     - On Linux, macOS, and other operating systems based on
       UNIX, you usually use the ``ssh`` command to connect to a host
       via SSH.

     - On Linux, macOS, and other UNIX-based operating systems.
       you usually use the ssh command to connect to a host via SSH.

   * - Don't use a trademark as a possessive or as a plural. If
       necessary, form a possessive or plural from the noun that
       follows the trademark (which is used as an adjective).

     - The packaged version of NGINX from Ubuntu uses a sites-available
       and sites-enabled layout in the same manner as an Apache
       installation based on Debian.

     - Ubuntu's packaged version of NGINX uses a sites-available and
       sites-enabled layout in the same manner as a Debian-based
       Apache installation.

   * - Always distinguish a third-party trademark from a MongoDB
       product name or trademark. Generally you can do this through
       ensuring that words intervene between the trademarks.

       Show trademarks of different companies together only if a
       license or agreement exists between the two companies. In such
       cases, use italics to distinguish one trademark from the other.
       You can generally do this just on first use of the two terms
       together in the document or article.
