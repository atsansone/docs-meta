For legal reasons, you must show third-party *names* and *trademarks*
correctly.

To learn more about writing third-party **trademarks**, see
:ref:`trademarks`.

- **Don't** use another company or product's logo, font, or color
  scheme.

- **Don't** use another company or product's trademarked name in a way
  that is demonstrably false or derogatory.

- **Don't** include anything with the trademarked name that would
  suggest the trademark holder sponsors or endorses a MongoDB product
  or service or MongoDB itself.
